This is a sub-product of my Master dissertation that is related to the study of the **households headship** in Brazil along the time.

The present exercise has the purpose of implementing Web Scraping dealing with broader studies in the area of bibliometrics.

With the help of Web Scraping, it is possible to analyze the issues associated with the phenomenon of household responsibility around the world!!!

This work is in progress :)
